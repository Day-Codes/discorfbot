### Getting ready

You need to get ready to start this specific complex bot well first put in that one token i told you to make in discord developers website, you should go to [config.json](https://BrightBot#config.json) then thats it, i have specifically made a bug free NFG bot so that you don't have to fix bugs for yourself

### Customazation time!
Customaize what the bot is, well this is time where you make it your own style well most of the customazation can go into the [config.json](https://BrightBot#config.json) file it is important to be creative in most cases but customaizing things that you don't know what it will do or incase don't know what it does is very dangerous and can end up with the robot bringing up the anti crash system to prevent a crash so please be careful what you do ***(Incase you do get in a error, you can undo the most recent part you have edited by using Ctrl+Z)***

All of the customazation is on you and you can easily skip this part ahead,
